    <h4>Support</h4>
    <p>The emulator support is a work-in-progress and does not provide any satisfactory experience yet. The graphic stack is known to be buggy and contributions are highly welcome.</p>
</div>

<p>OpenEmbedded can generate images for various emulators. Hence, it is very easy to compile AsteroidOS for the “qemux86” target with:</p>
<pre><code>. ./prepare-build.sh qemux86
bitbake asteroid-image
</code></pre>
<p>The preferred emulator is actually VirtualBox. You can open VBox, create a new virtual machine based on Linux 2.6 (32-bit) with 1024 MB of RAM and use the existing virtual hard disk file generated by OpenEmbedded in build/tmp-glibc/deploy/images/qemux86/asteroid-image-qemux86.vmdk</p>
<p>The usual graphic stack asteroid-launcher works on is based on the hwcomposer QPA which uses libhybris’s EGL and Android’s code. On VirtualBox, asteroid-launcher runs on the eglfs QPA which uses Mesa’s software rendering on top of the KMS interface offered by the virtualbox guest drivers.</p>
