<p>AsteroidOS translations, aside from the app name, are managed through <a href="https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/asteroidos/">Weblate</a>, a Free/Open Source web translation platform. To be able to use it, you will have to <a href="https://hosted.weblate.org/accounts/register/">register an account</a>, although you can also log in through a few popular third-party services. The rest of this page assumes you have an account.</p>

<p>Updating translations for an existing language is quite simple. Simply go to <a href="https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/asteroidos/">the AsteroidOS Weblate page</a>, choose the project and language you want to translate and start translating. If you want to update the app name, please create a GitHub pull request or issue with the appropriate change to the .desktop file, or <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/asteroid">join #asteroid on Freenode</a> to tell us about the desired change.</p>

  <h1 id="addingts">Adding a new supported language</h1>
</div>
<p>If the language you want to translate to is not supported yet, please <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/asteroid">join #asteroid on Freenode</a> to tell us which language you’d like to see supported and discuss with us what the correct app names would be in that language and we’ll set it up for you.</p>
